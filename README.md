## Descrition:

The Insulin-For-Kitties (I4K) team has completed the insulin dosimeter application. The requirements and constraints of the project have been taken into account and the application has been tested for accuracy using the existing syringe markings. The finished application uses computer image recognition via the built-in camera on the iPad to detect syringe features and provide volume measurements to the user. The product employs an easy to use graphical user interface which requires only that the user be able to center the syringe in the calculation area.

The completed application design meets the requirements set by the client.  Minor changes were made during development to increase usability such as streaming video over still images. The application currently supports one type of syringe and has been tested exclusively on the iPad 2.  False positive visual feature results are handled by reducing the detection region and ignoring outlier data points.  The software is designed to be an administrative tool for insulin dosage control.
